# Computer Science Essentials Glossary

abstraction
: a technique or process that manages complexity in a program or computer system. Abstraction "hides" details or removes duplication, allowing the programmer to focus on high-level considerations and functions rather than the rules of a programming language.

accessibility
: the usability of a computer interface for people with varying abilities

accumulator
: a role that a variable may take on in which it keeps a running or cumulative total or value. Commonly an accumulator is initialized outside of a loop, updated within the loop, and then its result is used outside of the loop.

aggregator
: a variable that adds together all the values or data at a specific moment

algorithm
: a set of steps to accomplish a specific task. An algorithm can be expressed in many kinds of notation, such as programming or natural language, pseudocode, and flowcharts. Algorithms are essential to the way computers process data because they contain the specific instructions for what a computer or program does.

allow list
: a list of websites that your school IT has approved for you to visit, although they might otherwise not be allowed through an internet filter

app
: a software application, especially one that a user downloads to a mobile device

append
: to add an element to an existing list. In Python, append() is a method that adds an object into an existing list.

application programming interface (API)
: specifications for how the procedures in a library behave and can be used

argument
: the variable or value that a program provides to a function or subroutine

arithmetic operator
: a symbol in code that tells a computer to perform a specific math operation, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division

array
: an ordered collection of elements of the same type

artificial intelligence (AI)
: intelligent behavior demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence of humans

assignment
: a statement that sets or stores a value in a variable

assignment operator
: a symbol in code that assigns a value on the right side of an equation (called an operand) to the variable on the left. Example: color = 255.

authenticate
: to verify a user's identity

authorized hacking
: ethically testing a system to find and fix weaknesses

backlog
: a sequential and prioritized list of what needs to be done to create the app the user wants. The list can be technical requirements or user centric in the form of user stories.

Bash
: the Bourne Again Shell (Bash) is a common shell application that provides a command-line interface. Other common shell applications are the C shell, the Bourne shell (sh), and the Korn shell.

best-so-far loop
: a piece of code (loop) that contains a variable which stores the "best" value as defined by the programmer. Each time the code executes, the program evaluates whether it finds a "better" value as defined by the programmer. If it finds one that is better, then it replaces that variable value with the new value and continues until it reaches the end of the list.

block
: any sequence of statements in Python that occur at the same indentation level

block-based programming language
: a means to create computer programs by manipulating elements graphically rather than using text. This is also called a visual programming language.

: an expression with relational operators that evaluates to either true or false

Boolean value
: one of two values, such as true or false

: to direct a program to execute or reference a certain procedure. A procedure is a subroutine that is stored only once but can be called many times in a program to execute when needed.

CamelCase
: a style of writing file names that avoids spaces and other characters and differentiates words based on capitalization. There are two forms: upper CamelCase (Example: StudentProject) and lower camelCase (Example: studentProject). Many programming languages require no spaces in file names.

A class specifies the behaviors (methods) and attributes (properties) that are related to an object. When an object is created from a class, the resulting object is called "an instance of the class."

cloud computing

conditional statement
: a feature of a programming language that performs different computations or actions depending on whether a Boolean condition evaluates to true or false

: a statement that keeps track of how many times a program has referenced and run through a loop. You can use a counting loop to count up or down based on the starting number, the incrementing math, and the ending criterion count value. A common use of a counting loop is to control how many times the loop runs. When the desired loop count number becomes the same as the specified condition to the end loop, the loop stops.

: a control flow statement that allows a set of instructions to be executed repeatedly. A for loop is usually used when the number of iterations is predefined, such as "execute this loop 10 times." Otherwise, a programmer might use a while loop, which would execute the loop repeatedly as long as a certain condition is met.
